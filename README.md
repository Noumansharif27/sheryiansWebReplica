**Title:** Course Selling Organization Website

**Description:** This website is a replica of a course selling organization website built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Features:**

<!-- - **Responsive Design:** The website adapts to different screen sizes for optimal viewing on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices (This assumes you have responsive CSS in place). -->

- **Content Structure:** The website is expected to have well-structured content sections (Replace with specific features of your website).
- **Automatic Dark Mode:** The website automatically implements dark mode based on the user's system preference (prefers-color-scheme) and allows manual switching (This depends on specific CSS implementation for dark mode styles).

**Technologies Used:**

- HTML: HyperText Markup Language (structure and content)
- CSS: Cascading Style Sheets (styling and presentation)
- JavaScript: Adds interactivity and functionality (automatic dark mode toggle in this case)

**Project Setup:**

2. Open the `index.html` file in a code editor.
3. Edit the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to customize the content and styling as needed.
